      The depth and quality of free curriculum offered by Code.org is impressive. Feel free to download the warm up I use to introduce students to computer science ande Code.org. Code.org has material to introduce kindergarteners who still struggle with reading programming concepts, and block based coding games for middle schoolers, also Code.org has a full year of AP C.S. curriculum. It is definitely worth looking into.

		<h2>Play a Game While Learning Code</h2>
      <p>The day I introduced my 8th grade classroom to CodeCombat was the first day they were completely silent. Battling through each level, students were engrossed in the game. Each level requires students to write code to progress through it. Using Python or JavaScript, teacher's choice, students beat levels while learning about comments, if statements, loops and more. The first course is completely free. It is easily a week of material for a teacher.</p>

		<h2>Build with Code Blocks</h2>
      <p>Scratch is well known. It pioneered the block-based programming languages, allowing code to become infinitely more accessible to students of all ages. The breadth of tutorials available for Scratch, make it approachable to all. Scratch is great for a quick lesson on Boolean variables, or a semester long project. It is a resource all C.S. teachers should utilize in their classroom.</p>
